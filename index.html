        <!--Adding JavaScript
        
            In Class Activity 1
            1. Create a web page (html document) called index2.html in the 
            folder called jsexamples. This html page should have the basic
            structure of an html page.

            2. Add JS to your simple html document so that is displays 
            New York City.

        What is wrong with the following code?

        5.99 * 1.65 = price_per-gallon

        We are missing the variable declaration keyword.
        The variable cannot contain hyphen -
        The variable where we want to keep our values should always be
        on the left of the =.

        How can we fix the above statement?
        let price_per_gallon = 5.99 * 1.65;

        or

        let price_per_gallon;
        price_per_gallon = 5.99 * 1.65;


        Variable names should describe the values they will be holding.


        What will be displayed by the following 3 lines of code?
        let age = 40;
        age = age + 1;
        console.log(age);


        Where can we place our JavaScript?
        A. In an html document inside the script tag
        B. In an html document inside the link tag
        C. In an html document inside the js tag
        D. In an html document inside the javascript tag
