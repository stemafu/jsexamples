        <!--Adding JavaScript
        
            In Class Activity 1
            1. Create a web page (html document) called index2.html in the 
            folder called jsexamples. This html page should have the basic
            structure of an html page.

            2. Add JS to your simple html document so that is displays 
            New York City.

       the parameters.
